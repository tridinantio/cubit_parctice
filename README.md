# cubit_practice

This is a project to practice with Bloc Cubit state management.
The functions are simple: 

- The app will load list of images from https://picsum.photos/v2/list and display it in a ListView by using Bloc state management. It also takes the information of the image like author name, sizing, url etc.

The second function is to give a description of the image and save the description in a bloc state.
